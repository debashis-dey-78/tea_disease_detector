    """,
    'rr': """
        **Disease: Red Rust** **Description:** Red rust is a common disease of tea plants caused by an alga, *Cephaleuros virescens*. It appears as orange-brown, velvety patches on leaves and can sometimes affect stems, leading to dieback if severe.
        **Management:** * Improve air circulation by proper pruning and spacing.
        * Manage shade to reduce humidity.
        * Apply appropriate copper-based fungicides if the infestation is severe and widespread, following local agricultural guidelines.
        * Ensure balanced plant nutrition.
    """,
    'rsm': """
        **Pest: Red Spider Mites** **Description:** Red spider mites (*Oligonychus coffeae*) are common pests that suck sap from tea leaves, leading to a reddish-brown or bronze discoloration and sometimes fine webbing, especially on the undersides of leaves. Severe infestations can reduce yield and quality.
        **Management:** * Maintain plant vigor through proper irrigation and fertilization.
        * Encourage natural predators of mites.
        * Use approved miticides if infestation is heavy and causing economic damage. Consider spot treatments.
        * Regularly monitor for early signs of infestation.
    """,
    'bb': """
        **Disease: Brown Blight** **Description:** Brown blight, caused by the fungus *Colletotrichum spp.* (often *Colletotrichum camelliae*), leads to distinct brown, often circular or irregular lesions on tea leaves. These lesions may have concentric rings and can enlarge, causing defoliation.
        **Management:** * Prune and destroy affected plant parts to reduce inoculum.
        * Ensure proper plant spacing for good air circulation.
        * Apply fungicides (e.g., mancozeb, copper-based) as recommended by local agricultural experts, especially during wet conditions favorable for fungal growth.
        * Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization.
